Power Pins
----------
GND - this is the common ground for all power and logic
BAT - this is the positive voltage to/from the JST jack for the optional Lipoly battery
USB - this is the positive voltage to/from the micro USB jack if connected
EN - this is the 3.3V regulator's enable pin. It's pulled up, so connect to ground to disable the 3.3V regulator
3V - this is the output from the 3.3V regulator. The regulator can supply 500mA peak but half of that is drawn by the ESP32, and it's a fairly power-hungry chip. So if you need a ton of power for stuff like LEDs, motors, etc. Use the USB or BAT pins, and an additional regulator

Logic pins
----------
This is the general purpose I/O pin set for the microcontroller. All logic is 3.3V
The ESP32 runs on 3.3V power and logic, and unless otherwise specified, GPIO pins are not 5V safe!

Serial pins
----------
RX and TX are the additional Serial1 pins, and are not connected to the USB/Serial converter. That means you can use them to connect to UART-devices like GPS's, fingerprint sensors, etc.
The TX pin is the output from the module. The RX pin is the input into the module. Both are 3.3V logic

I2C & SPI pins
----------
You can use the ESP32 to control I2C and SPI devices, sensors, outputs, etc. If using with Arduino, the standard Wire and SPI devices work as you'd expect!
Note that the I2C pins do not have pullup resistors already! You must add them if you want to communicate with an I2C device

GPIO & Analog Pins
----------
GPIO26 - This is also analog input A0 and an analog output DAC2. It uses ADC #2
GPIO25 - This is also analog input A1 and an analog output DAC1. It uses ADC #2
GPIO34 - This is also analog input A2 on ADC #1. Note it is not an output-capable.
GPIO39 - This is also analog input A3 on ADC #1. Note it is not an output-capable.
GPIO36 - This is also analog input A4 on ADC #1. Note it is not an output-capable.
GPIO04 - This is also analog input A5 on ADC #2
GPIO21 - General purpose IO
GPIO13 - This is also an analog input A12 on ADC #2. It's also connected to the red LED next to the USB port
GPIO12 - This is also an analog input A11 on ADC #2. This pin has a pull-down resistor built into it, we recommend using it as an output only, or making sure that the pull-down is not affected during boot.
GPIO27 - This is also an analog input A10 on ADC #2
GPIO33 - This is also an analog input A9 on ADC #1. It can also be used to connect a 32 KHz crystal.
GPIO15 - This is also an analog input A8 on ADC #2
GPIO32 - This is also an analog input A7 on ADC #1. It can also be used to connect a 32 KHz crystal.
GPIO14 - This is also an analog input A6 on ADC #2

There's also an external analog input
A13 - This is general purpose input #35 and also an analog input A13, which is a resistor divider connected to the VBAT line
